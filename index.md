On this site, you can see a top ten list of modules that I have worked on throughout the semester, as well as see my experiences while working on them and how I have grown as a student.

# Top 10 list
1. Space invaders -> This module was the summative for the class. I will continue to learn programming and computer science concepts through growing my creative side of programming. This module was my favourite to work on as it allowed me to put the puzzle pieces together and forced me to come up with my own ideas on my own instead of following specific intructions like the other modules. This project also incorporated almost everything I've learned in the semester.

2. Intro to Html -> This module taught how to make a website and the different tools you can use to create a personal website. This module helped me learn the basics of web design and has motivated me to learn more in this field. This module engaged me with the course because it was interesting and challenging at the same time. 

3. Intro to CSS -> This module was the other half of HTML, but I consider it to be a different module in its own. This module helped me learn the actual language used to make a website. This taught me how to use the language and that you can use it in other ways as well which boosts creativity in this field. 

4. Computers -> This module taught the basics of computer parts and how computers work. This module was very interesting and helped answer questions like how computers work and what each part does. This is the more hands on approach to computers and it engaged me a lot because of this.

5. Algorithms -> This moduled taught me the theory of algorithms and helped visualize what they do. This was a bit more boring because it wasn't as creative oriented but it still was important to complete because it is the building blocks for intermidiate programming. This module motivates me to make algorithms more efficient and makes me want to learn more about them in the future.

6. Internet 101 -> Websites would not be possible without internet. This module taught me the history of the internet, how the internet works, and how computer scientists are working to make it better. This module answered many questions I had about the internet and gave me insight to the building blocks of the internet which helps me understand what I am doing when making a website or simply browsing on the Google. 
7. Intro to JS -> This module taught me how to use a coding language to make shapes, drawing, and animations. This was a very interesting module and allowed me to use my creativity while learning about the language. This makes me want to continue learning the language because it is a useful tool to use to make creative concepts.

8. Advanced JS:Natural Simulations (Randomness) -> This module was a more advanced version of Intro to JS. You use more advanced mathematical concepts and apply it to the programming. It was more difficult but was still interesting and makes me want to work with these sort of mathematical concepts in the future.

9. Ancient Cryptography -> This module explains how messages are encrypted and the history of encryption. It was very interesting because it taught me how to enrypt messages like security companies do and it was very fun to do. It makes me want to research more about this topic and attempt to make cryptogoraphy more efficient (potentially) in the future.

10. FreeCodeCamp - Responsive Web Design Principles -> This smaller module was very interesting to me because it taught me basic web design tools. This is a field that I would like to get into maybe in a career because it allows you to use creativity while programming in different languages at the same time.
